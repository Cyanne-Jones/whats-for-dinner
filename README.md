#What's for Dinner?
###Can't decide? Let ✨magic✨ decide for you!

##Overview

Welcome to Cyanne's Tome Shop of Recipes! In this *incredibly* niche bookshop, you can use our House Recipe Spell™ to figure out what to cook when you simply can't decide!

To use this powerful tool, clone this repository to your computer and open up index.html in your web browser and get ready to cast some spells! This tool is even responsive to your different screen sizes for those pesky on-the-go dinner decisions.

###Is it *really** magic?

Absolutely not, but it sure does feel like it! This project was made using vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS in 2022 by Cyanne Jones. You can access my GitHub [here](https://github.com/Cyanne-Jones)!


###Future ideas for this project:
- I think adding photos of the food items might be fun to really make it pop.
- A little sprite animation of a witch stirring the cook pot would be so so cute! Maybe a little pixel art witch!
- Twinkle sound effects upon spell cast???
